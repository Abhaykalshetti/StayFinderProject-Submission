  // 2. Backend calls Stripe API to create a Payment Intent.
  // 3. Backend returns the Payment Intent client_secret to frontend.
  // 4. Frontend uses stripe.confirmCardPayment(client_secret, { payment_method: { card: elements.getElement(CardElement) } });

  console.log("Mock Payment Processing with:", paymentDetails);

// In a full Stripe integration, you would also have a backend endpoint
// that creates a Payment Intent and returns its client_secret to the frontend.
// The frontend would then use @stripe/react-stripe-js to confirm the payment.
